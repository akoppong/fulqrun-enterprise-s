```

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. **Enhanced Filtering System**
```typescript
const filteredOpportunities = opportunities.filter(opp => {
  const matchesSearch = // Multi-field search
  const matchesStage = // Stage-based filtering
  const matchesValueRange = // Value range filtering
  return matchesSearch && matchesStage && matchesValueRange;
});
```

### 2. **Real-time Metrics Calculation**
```typescript
const getPipelineMetrics = () => ({
  totalValue: sortedOpportunities.reduce((sum, opp) => sum + opp.value, 0),
  averageValue: totalValue / sortedOpportunities.length,
  stageDistribution: PEAK_STAGES.map(stage => ({...}))
});
```

### 3. **MEDDPICC Scoring Integration**
```typescript
const getMEDDPICCScore = (meddpicc: MEDDPICC): number => {
  // 7-point qualification scoring
  // Returns percentage-based score
};
```

### 4. **AI Insights Integration**
```typescript
const generateAIInsights = async () => {
  const insights = await AIService.analyzeOpportunity(
    opportunity, contact, company
  );
  // Risk scoring, next actions, competitive analysis
};
```

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Color-coded Stages**: Each PEAK stage has distinct visual identity
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars for probability and MEDDPICC scores
- **Status Badges**: Clear status indication with semantic colors
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle hover effects and transitions

### Interaction Design
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions appear on hover to reduce visual clutter
- **Modal Workflows**: Seamless create/edit/view workflows
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support
- **Touch Optimization**: Mobile-friendly touch targets

### Information Architecture
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear information hierarchy
- **Tabbed Content**: Logical grouping of related information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show details on demand
- **Contextual Help**: Inline guidance and tooltips

## Data Integration

### Company & Contact Linking
- Automatic filtering of contacts by selected company
- Rich company and contact information display
- Direct communication links (email, phone)

### Pipeline Analytics
- Real-time pipeline value calculations
- Stage distribution analysis
- Win probability trending
- Average deal size metrics

### AI-Enhanced Qualification
- Intelligent MEDDPICC scoring
- Risk factor identification
- Competitive positioning analysis
- Predictive close date modeling

## Sample Data

The system includes comprehensive sample data:
- **3 Companies**: Different industries and sizes
- **4 Contacts**: Various roles and influence levels  
- **3 Opportunities**: Different stages with complete MEDDPICC data
- **AI Insights**: Realistic risk scores and recommendations

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Opportunity
1. Click "New Opportunity" button
2. Fill in basic information (title, value, company, contact)
3. Select PEAK stage and set probability
4. Complete MEDDPICC qualification
5. Generate AI insights for recommendations
6. Auto-save preserves drafts during editing

### Managing Pipeline
1. Use filters to focus on specific stages or value ranges
2. Sort by various criteria (value, probability, close date)
3. Switch between table and card views
4. Monitor pipeline metrics in real-time

### Opportunity Analysis
1. Click opportunity to view detailed information
2. Review MEDDPICC qualification completeness
3. Analyze AI-generated risk factors and recommendations
4. Track activity and updates over time
