# Fixed Duplicate Export Error

## Issue
The error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Duplicate export of 'MEDDPICCScoringService'" was caused by multiple export statements for the same class in the codebase.

## Root Cause
Two files were exporting the `MEDDPICCScoringService` class multiple times:

1. `/src/services/meddpicc-scoring-service.ts` - Had the class exported at line 54 and then re-exported again at line 466
2. `/src/services/meddpicc-service.ts` - Was re-exporting the class at line 730 even though it was already imported

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed meddpicc-scoring-service.ts
**Before:**
```typescript
export class MEDDPICCScoringService {
  // ... class implementation
}

// Re-export all types and classes explicitly
export { MEDDPICCAnswer, MEDDPICCAssessment, MEDDPICCTrend, MEDDPICCBenchmark, MEDDPICCInsight, MEDDPICCScoringService };
```

**After:**
```typescript
export class MEDDPICCScoringService {
  // ... class implementation
}

// Re-export all types explicitly (class is already exported above)
export type { MEDDPICCAnswer, MEDDPICCAssessment, MEDDPICCTrend, MEDDPICCBenchmark, MEDDPICCInsight };
```

### 2. Fixed meddpicc-service.ts
**Before:**
```typescript
// Export types and service
export {
  MEDDPICCAssessment,
  MEDDPICCTrend,
  MEDDPICCBenchmark,
  MEDDPICCInsight,
  MEDDPICCScoringService
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Export types (service is already imported above)
export type {
  MEDDPICCAssessment,
  MEDDPICCTrend,
  MEDDPICCBenchmark,
  MEDDPICCInsight
};
```

## Verification
After the fixes:
- Only one export of `MEDDPICCScoringService` class exists in `meddpicc-scoring-service.ts`
- The class is properly re-exported through the index file at `components/meddpicc/index.ts`
- All imports continue to work correctly
- No duplicate export errors

## Current Export Structure
```
src/services/meddpicc-scoring-service.ts
├── exports: MEDDPICCScoringService (class)
└── exports: MEDDPICCAnswer, MEDDPICCAssessment, etc. (types)

src/components/meddpicc/index.ts
└── re-exports: MEDDPICCScoringService from meddpicc-scoring-service
```

The error has been successfully resolved.
