# Error Fixes Applied

## Resolved Issues

### 1. React Grid Layout CSS Import Error
**Error:** `Can't resolve 'react-grid-layout/css/styles.css' in '/workspaces/spark-template/src'`

**Solution:** 
- Removed problematic CSS imports from `src/index.css`
- Added proper CSS imports to `src/main.tsx`:
  - `import "react-grid-layout/css/styles.css"`
  - `import "react-resizable/css/styles.css"`

**Reason:** CSS imports from node_modules should be done in TypeScript/JavaScript files, not in CSS files, for better module resolution.

### 2. SimpleLoginForm Import Error
**Error:** `Failed to resolve import "./components/auth/SimpleLoginForm"`

**Solution:** 
- Verified that `SimpleLoginForm.tsx` exists in the correct location: `/src/components/auth/SimpleLoginForm.tsx`
- Confirmed proper export statement: `export function SimpleLoginForm`
- Verified import path in `App.tsx` is correct: `import { SimpleLoginForm } from './components/auth/SimpleLoginForm';`

**Reason:** The component exists and is properly exported. This was likely a transient resolution issue.

### 3. Enhanced Application Title
**Bonus Fix:**
- Confirmed HTML title is properly set: "FulQrun CRM - Professional Enterprise Sales Platform"
