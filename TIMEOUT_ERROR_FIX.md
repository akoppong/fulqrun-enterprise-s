# AI Timeout Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Request timeout" errors from AI service calls that were taking too long to complete, causing:
- Hanging operations with no user feedback
- Poor user experience when AI services are slow
- Application errors that weren't properly handled

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **AI Timeout Wrapper Service** (`/src/lib/ai-timeout-wrapper.ts`)
- Created a reusable timeout wrapper for all AI calls
- Implements 30-second timeout with 2 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Centralized error handling for timeout scenarios

### 2. **Enhanced AI Service** (`/src/lib/ai-service.ts`)  
- Updated all AI service methods to use the timeout wrapper
- Added timeout-specific error detection and messaging
- Improved fallback values with timeout context
- Better error messages that distinguish between timeouts and other failures

### 3. **Component Updates**
Updated all components that use AI services to:
- Import and use the timeout wrapper
- Provide timeout-specific user feedback via toasts
- Handle timeout errors gracefully with appropriate messaging

**Updated Components:**
- `/src/components/dashboard/EnhancedMEDDPICCDialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ai-qualification/AILeadScoring.tsx`
- `/src/components/ai-qualification/AIDealRiskAssessment.tsx`
- `/src/components/ai-qualification/AIQualificationDashboard.tsx`
- `/src/components/pipeline/EnhancedMEDDPICCQualification.tsx`

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Timeout errors now show specific "timed out" messages vs generic failures
- Fallback data includes timeout context in results
- All AI errors are logged appropriately for debugging
- Users receive actionable feedback (e.g., "please try again")

## Key Features
- **30-second timeout**: Prevents indefinite hanging
- **Automatic retries**: 2 attempts with exponential backoff  
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Application continues working with demo/default data
- **Clear user feedback**: Toast notifications explain timeout vs other errors
- **Consistent error handling**: All AI services use the same timeout logic

## User Experience Improvements
- No more silent hanging when AI services are slow
- Clear indication when AI features timeout vs other failures  
- Application remains functional even when AI services are unavailable
- Users know to retry AI operations when they fail due to timeouts

## Technical Benefits
- Centralized timeout logic prevents code duplication
- Consistent error handling across all AI features
- Better debugging information with detailed error logging
- Maintainable and testable timeout handling

The timeout error should now be properly handled with user-friendly messages and automatic retries.
